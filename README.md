# Sportsradar-Tennis Project

## Overview
Hi, my name is Rahulraj K M. I am currently pursuing a certification in Data Science. As part of the syllabus, I have worked on the **Sportsradar-Tennis Project**. This project involves working with tennis data retrieved from an API and managing it efficiently for further analysis and visualization.

## Project Workflow

1. **Database Creation**:
   - Created a separate SQL database named `tennis`.
   - Designed and implemented six tables with proper syntax and schema design to store the retrieved data effectively.

2. **Data Retrieval**:
   - Used Python to fetch tennis data from the Sportsradar API.

3. **Data Storage**:
   - Processed the API data and inserted it into the `tennis` database using Python scripts.

4. **SQL Queries**:
   - Executed all the required SQL queries as per the project requirements to manipulate and analyze the stored data.

5. **Visualization with Streamlit**:
   - Built an interactive Streamlit web application to display and analyze the tennis data.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Database**: SQL (Structured Query Language)
- **API**: Sportsradar API
